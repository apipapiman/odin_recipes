    <h2> Descripton </h2>

    <p>Believe it or not, you can make this incredibly simple dish with just four ingredients:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong>You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).</li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan:</strong>Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and Pepper:</strong>Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Stir in fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain and return pasta to pot. Mix butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper into pasta until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
